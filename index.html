- fuck this takes forever
- game updates
	- drawSprites type list of sprites
	- Game.sprites and Game.ui defaults
	- Game.scenes default?
	- test performance of game with array vs object for ui/scenes
	- loading may just have to be handled by individual games ....
	- load animations first then make classes ... 
	- what purpose do items have? why not just sprites?
		- update function not in sprite for map
	- generally heading towards objects not automatically adding stuff
	- player/map relationship is super confusing ... 
	- p5 play style camera?
	- make a debug draw function
	- really need to wait for sprites to actually load!
	- just load json to make different animations ...
		- too many anim objects?
	- texture is really annoying, need to separate functions better
	- dont render until offset applied

	- player collisions with map not working
		- separate display function for player?

- rename animation class ... fuck
- lines problems
	- title needs to be blur, enter saves the file ...
	- drawing is undefined at some point, maybe after save?
	- collapsed panels start with - instead of +
	- layers css fucked up
	- dont save points outside of canvas ... 
	- zoom fucks up canvas
	- single frame capture bg always there

3.7.2020
