3.5.2020
- fuck this takes forever
- game updates
	- drawSprites type list of sprites
	- Game.sprites and Game.ui defaults
	- Game.scenes default?
	- test performance of game with array vs object for ui/scenes
	- loading may just have to be handled by individual games ....
	- load animations first then make classes ... 
	- what purpose do items have? why not just sprites?
		- update function not in sprite for map
	- generally heading towards objects not automatically adding stuff
	- player/map relationship is super confusing ... 
	- p5 play style camera?
	- make a debug draw function
	- really need to wait for sprites to actually load!
	- just load json to make different animations ...
		- too many anim objects?
	- texture is really annoying, need to separate functions better
	- dont render until offset applied

	- player collisions with map not working
		- separate display function for player?
	- stat class
	- sprite use w h instead of width and height
	- why does fps cap at 9?
	- item vs sprite, params vs xy inconsistent

	- what the actual fuck
	- need names of positions to make sense
	- item update func is more generic map thing
	- i'm dismantling this stupid fucking system backwards ..
	- player position isn't supposed to change
	- text + ui class for food 

- rename animation class ... fuck
- lines problems

	- layers css fucked up
		- first try completely new layers thing "timeline"
	- lines on sidecar dont take on mobile stuff ...
	- zoom ui and canvas separately ...
	- cant draw on top part zoomed in after reset .... fixed by doing R/L instead of L/R

- lines needs immediate fix
	- new drawing doesn't retain new lines setup
	- insert doesn't work with layers ...


3.7.2020
- fix starting point
- buffer one cell
- dirt more sparse
- cluster walls
- smaller skully
- buffer half screen width at least
- wall collisions
	- everything centered vs not centered
- need puddles 

- to do -
	- grass in hell?
	- partition collisions and test performance
	- walls are off
	- player gets stuck while clicking...
	- player spawns on wall ...
	- boundaries also off now ...
