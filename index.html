- fuck this takes forever
- game updates
	- drawSprites type list of sprites
	- Game.sprites and Game.ui defaults
	- Game.scenes default?
	- test performance of game with array vs object for ui/scenes
	- loading may just have to be handled by individual games ....
	- load animations first then make classes ... 
	- what purpose do items have? why not just sprites?
		- update function not in sprite for map
	- generally heading towards objects not automatically adding stuff
	- player/map relationship is super confusing ... 
	- p5 play style camera?
	- make a debug draw function
	- really need to wait for sprites to actually load!
	- just load json to make different animations ...
		- too many anim objects?
	- texture is really annoying, need to separate functions better
	- dont render until offset applied

	- player collisions with map not working
		- separate display function for player?
	- stat class
	- sprite use w h instead of width and height
	- why does fps cap at 9?
	- item vs sprite, params vs xy inconsistent

	- what the actual fuck
	- need names of positions to make sense
	- item update func is more generic map thing
	- i'm dismantling this stupid fucking system backwards ..
	- player position isn't supposed to change
	- text + ui class for food 

	- consolidate button and toggle and text ... 
	- sub classes don't fetch 

- rename animation class ... fuck
- lines problems

	- layers css fucked up
		- first try completely new layers thing "timeline"
	- lines on sidecar dont take on mobile stuff ...
	- zoom ui and canvas separately ...
	- cant draw on top part zoomed in after reset .... fixed by doing R/L instead of L/R
	- state updates when using next prev
	- update canvas size when fitting to canvas ...
	- turn off cursor optoin  for ipad

- lines needs immediate fix
	- new drawing doesn't retain new lines setup
	- insert doesn't work with layers ...


3.7.2020
- fix starting point
- buffer one cell
- dirt more sparse
- cluster walls
- smaller skully
- buffer half screen width at least
- wall collisions
	- everything centered vs not centered
- need puddles 

- to do -
	- grass in hell?
	- partition collisions and test performance
	- player gets stuck while clicking...
		- adjust player collider
	- player spawns on wall ...
	- game better name for .data
	- text.js active vs sprite.js alive (really "visible")
	- item on wall ... 
	- item ui class 


4.3.2020
- after jam list of stuff to do
4.8.2020
	- get inventory buttons to work
		- consider adding separate button sprites ...
			- and remove over/out/down/up states from sprite class
		- add set position or position setter to sprite to make positions updates consistent
		- after adding sprite, should click on it to change menu
		- switch drop buttons ... 
		- invetory items/messages are not getting removed correctly ...
			- maybe just create and delete everything instead of moving everything around so much ...
4.9.2020	
	- rename "alive/active"
		- isActive is best for now

4.11.2020
	- optimize map generation
		- rooms take longer 
			- loading json takes time, many references to same json
			- this is probably normal
			- texture with many locations is loading a new animation for each one, readings drawings etc.
			- *implement the text approach to drawing an animation in multiple places ...
				- textures aren't interactive, can be anims not sprites...
				- walls have their own colliders
				- this is because drawings are unpacking arrays [x,y] to objects {x: 0, y: 0}
					- sacrificed load time for 
				- this is probably same issue with walls, they all textures with multiple locations ...
				- there is still an animation for every texture -- definitely game level issue
			- maybe game.load makes animations and somehow everything references the animations?
			- optimize animation load drawing time ... 
				- or just use [x, y]
			- *items were centering themselves, textures don't do that - items were also checking if they were on the fucking screen .... 

	- text wrap for messages based on 960 browser window ... or 1280

	- figure out sinners + food/scripture
	- update other game components
	- room/path setup like the walls
	- maps get progressively more complex
		- figure out probabilities of map balance ...
	- read and pick up icons
	- get rid of roudned numbers

	- its very annoying to have to remove elements from map/inventory AND the correct parts of the scene updates ...
